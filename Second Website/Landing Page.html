    <p id="title">3 Tips For Productivity</p>

    <p class="sub">Tip 1: Wake up early</p>
    <p class="text">
      Sleeping daily can affect your mental health in many ways. It can help you
      work more accurately, and stay productive throughout the day. Nothing is
      better than having a sleep schedule. You may say: I alwasy make sure to
      sleep up to 9 hours a day, but don't have a strict schedule, but don't
      feel good about myself. The point here is to show you that even if you had
      great amount of sleep, that doesn't mean that you will feel good about it.
      Studies shown that people who sleep between 7 and 9 hours are less
      productive, comparing to the people who sleep between the 10 PM and 7 AM.
      It doesn't matter if you can all those amount of sleep, if you don't have
      a strict sleep schedule that you're willing to stick to.

    <p class="sub">Tip 2: Exercice Daily</p>
    <p class="text">
      Working out daily can help you endure hard tasks and challenges. You will
      make sure you have 100% ability to concentrate throughout the day.Working
      out in the mornings has also shown some benefits, from increased energy to
      low stress levels. There's no doubt that working out in the morning can
      let you feel good about yourself. But what about your school or job? What
      about your family and kids. How do you manage time? This is were the idea
      of flexible workout routine comes to: Unlike sleep, you can easily do
      workouts througout the day at any time. If the morning is a good fit for
      you, that workout in the morning. If the evening is great, do it. The
      important thing is to show up, and not make a full workout. If one day you
      feel like you don't want to workout, it's okay. Go to the gym (or your
      house), and show up. Do Do some streches, and maybe any light exercise,
      and that's it.
    </p>
    <p class="sub">Tip 3: Meditate</p>
    <p class="text">
      Meditation was always something peaceful, and it will always be. Unlike
      many celebrities, Katy Perry and Oprah Winfrey believes that meditation is
      the practice of silencing the thoughts in your mind to achieve awareness.
      And you should do it too. Maybe you choose to workout only. Maybe
      meditation only. Maybe both. But what's important is remembering that you
      have to maintain the peacful and calm mind to live a happy life. You have
      to know when to sprint and when to rest. Burnout is the result of not
      regulary checking your mental state. Hard work is important, but doing it
      in a conscious way is important to. We should not forget that we are
      humans, and overworking can make us make some mistakes.

      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
      1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
      make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
      also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
      unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
      sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages
